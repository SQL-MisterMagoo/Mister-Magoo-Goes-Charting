# Blazor Charts

Chart components for Blazor

This is a work in progress, not production ready.

# Vertical Bar Chart

There is only one chart in the project at the moment, a vertical bar chart.

It doesn't have bells and whistles - or very much of anything.

**usage:**

See the BlazorBarChartMM project for examples (very ugly - don't complain)

*Basic usage:*

```
<BarChartVertical Data="@listOfValues"
	BarStyle="@BlazorBarStyle.Normal"
	ChartHeight="250" />
```

For now, you will have to dig into the code to figure out all the options - I will document later.
